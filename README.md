# Loan Default Prediction
Project Overview
This project is aimed at predicting whether a loan will default using machine learning techniques. The project covers the entire workflow from data collection and exploration to preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and reporting. Two models were implemented—a Logistic Regression and a Random Forest classifier—to compare performance on predicting loan defaults.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains loan application records and associated features such as:

Loan_Amount

Interest_Rate

Loan_Term

Income

Credit_Score

Employment_Status

Loan_Status (target variable)

Additional features were engineered including Loan-to-Income ratio, Interest Rate Per Month, Monthly Payment, and Total Payment to enhance the predictive performance.

Usage
Data Exploration and Cleaning:
Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the dataset, check for missing values, outliers, duplicates, and to perform data visualization.

Feature Engineering and Preprocessing:
The notebook guides you through creating additional features, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Preprocessing is managed via pipelines to ensure consistency.

Model Training and Evaluation:
Both Logistic Regression and Random Forest models are implemented. The notebook includes code to:

Train models using the preprocessed data.

Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curves.

Address warnings and potential convergence issues (for example, by increasing the number of iterations).

Deployment (Optional):
As a bonus, you could deploy the model using either Flask or Streamlit. This would enable building a simple web interface for real-time predictions.

To run the notebook, launch Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook jupyter_notebook.ipynb
Model Performance
The models were evaluated using several metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

ROC Curve and AUC

Detailed outputs and visualizations are included in the notebook to help interpret the results. Compare the performance of the Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to choose the best performing model.

Future Improvements
Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilize GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find optimal model parameters.

Handling Imbalanced Data: Implement techniques like SMOTE or class weighting if the target variable remains imbalanced.

Feature Selection Enhancements: Explore additional selection methods (e.g., VIF, chi-square tests) to further refine input features.

Deployment: Develop an interactive front-end using Flask or Streamlit to allow users to input parameters and see prediction results in real time.

Model Comparison: Experiment with additional algorithms such as XGBoost or ensemble methods to improve prediction accuracy.

Deployment
For a bonus, consider creating a simple web application using either Flask or Streamlit:

Flask: Build an API that receives input features and returns a prediction.

Streamlit: Create an interactive dashboard for exploring model predictions.
